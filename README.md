A new set of copycats with more complex geometry. Note that connected textures or translucency may not work perfectly on
some of them.

Linked Transmitters can now be locked by sneak-right-clicking the transmitter module to prevent misclicks on the
frequency slots.

**Various bug fixes**

Multiple crashes have been fixed. If you've had issues with Create: Connected in your modpacks before, please try again
