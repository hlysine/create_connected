## What's new in 0.9

![inventory_access_port](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f8bc2b-3c63-4aa4-a068-f581e114a4a0) **Inventory Access Port**

Attach to any inventory to expand its surface area. Great for access in tight spaces and smart setups with threshold switches.

![inventory_bridge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a92555a4-4f27-441a-8128-4c03edccdb85) **Inventory Bridge**

Provides an interface to access two inventories simultaneously. Also comes with filter slots to quickly sort incoming items.

More bulk processing compatibility with Create: Dreams and Desires. Only appears when Create: Dreams and Desires is installed.

**Note for 1.18 and 1.19 users**

Create has dropped support for 1.18 and 1.19 since 0.5.1g. As a result, backporting to 1.18 and 1.19 is no longer
a priority for Create: Connected. Depending on circumstances, updates will be delayed and new features may not be backported.
