Stores kinetic stress for later use. Retains charge in item form to enable long-distance energy transport. Battery capacity, RPM at discharge and stress impact values are all configurable.

![cross_connector](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e099e1aa-7e06-43e7-a33a-a906dd706336) **Cross Connector**
