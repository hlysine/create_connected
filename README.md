A new set of copycats with more complex geometry. Note that connected textures or translucency may not work perfectly on
some of them.

**Lockable Linked Transmitter**

![linked_transmitter](https://github.com/hlysine/create_connected/assets/25472513/edb1593f-e815-4a36-b0bb-91ae0eb318bf)

Linked Transmitters can now be locked by sneak-right-clicking the transmitter module to prevent misclicks on the
frequency slots.

**Various bug fixes**

Multiple crashes have been fixed. If you've had issues with Create: Connected in your modpacks before, please try again
with this new version.
