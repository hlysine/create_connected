## Issues

### Reporting bugs

- For crashes, please paste your crash log in https://mclo.gs/ and include it in your issue.
- Please include steps to trigger the bug and screenshots in your issue if applicable.
- Mod incompatibilities may not always be fixed if the issue is not on C:Connected's side.

### Feature suggestions

New ideas are always welcome, but here's a general rule on things that I probably **won't** add to the mod:

- Features that involve major gameplay changes or large system reworks, such as overhauling how trains/steam engines
  work
- Features that remove/replace base Create functionality, such as nerfing a Create feature just to reintroduce it in a
  higher-tier item
- Features that are too far away from base Create, such as electrical networks

## Translations

Translations are very welcomed! To simplify the whole
process, [a Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/create-connected-mod) has been set up for all translations. You
can find some guides on how to use Crowdin here:

## Pull requests

### Ponders

Ponders are very welcomed! My goal is to set up ponder scenes for all items that would have gotten a ponder in base
Create. There
is [a short guide on Create's wiki](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Internal---Ponder-UI) on how to
create ponders.

### Fabric port

I have no plans of porting the mod to Fabric, but Fabric forks are welcome. Please let me know if you decide to work on
it. I can also provide help by explaining some of the mod's inner workings.

### New features

Please **open an issue for discussion** before working on new features so that no effort is wasted. A complete feature
would include block
logic, textures, models, feature toggle, configs and ponder, but I'll accept PRs as long as the first 3 are done.

PRs are welcome even if you are new to modding, but please be patient with them while we work on polishing your code
together.
